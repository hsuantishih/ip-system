# IP Management System  

This repository contains an IP Management System designed to efficiently organize and manage IP addresses. The system supports two types of user roles: administrators and regular users, each with tailored functionalities.

## General Features  

### Login and Logout Functionality  
The system ensures secure login and logout processes, validated through the school database and robust authentication mechanisms. Access is restricted to current school faculty, staff, and students. User permissions are role-specific, ensuring appropriate access control.

## Administrator Features  

### IP Address Calculation  
Administrators can calculate IP addresses based on subnet masks, determining the number of available IP addresses within a subnet and allocating them efficiently. Occupied IP addresses are identified, and the system displays the number of available IP addresses to facilitate effective management.
